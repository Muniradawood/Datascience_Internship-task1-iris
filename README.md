Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset

Objective:
The goal of this task is to learn how to:
    * Load a dataset
    * Summarize its details
    * Create simple visualizations to understand it better

We are using the **Iris dataset**, which has measurements of flower parts (sepal and petal) for three types of Iris flowers.

🛠 Approach
1. Load the dataset using pandas and seaborn.  
2. Look at the data with shape, columns, and first few rows.  
3. Check for missing values and basic statistics.  
4. Make simple graphs:
   * Scatter plot to see relationships between features  
   * Histogram to see data distribution  
   * Box plot to check outliers and compare species  

📊 Results and Insights
* The dataset has 150 rows and 5 columns.  
* There are no missing values.  
* The Setosa species looks very different from the other two species in terms of petal and sepal sizes.  
* Histograms show the natural spread of data for each measurement.  
* Box plots show that Setosa flowers have much smaller petals compared to Versicolor and Virginica.  

▶️ How to Run
 Install the required libraries:
  * bash
  * pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib
